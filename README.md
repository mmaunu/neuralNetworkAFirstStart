# neuralNetworkAFirstStart
Just me actually writing some code for neural networks rather than just reading and nodding my head.

So, this also uses some large datasets and/or some large files that I created (just serialized the datasets). 
These represent the MNIST digit datasets (70,000 images in total...the serialized versions are the images loaded 
into objects that represent training data, or more specifically MNISTDigitTrainingRecord objects).
